\details{
The function searches for a given string with a given type. Ordering and quality of the results depends on Facebook's algorithm.

\code{location}, \code{education} and \code{workplace} are typed into the search fields, and if there is any, the first offered string will be chosen.

Interactive login is supported, if either \code{user_login} or \code{user_password} is missing, the function will wait until the user logs in.

The attributes argument must be a named list or vector, with names chosen from
the given list, or any other filter type which occurs on Facebook.
