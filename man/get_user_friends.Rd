}
\usage{
get_user_friends(user, login_name, login_password, ...)
}

\arguments{
  \item{user}{
one length character vector, the profile address of the target user, for example: "atajti" 
}
  \item{login_name}{
Optioinal, one length character vector, containing the string which should be used for login. Either profile name, phone nuber or e-mail address. If not supplied, the user can login in the opening browser
}
  \item{login_password}{
Optional, one length character vector, containing the password. If not supplied, the user can login in the opening browser.
}
  \item{...}{
Optional arguments passed to \code{remoteDriver}.
}
}
\details{
The function opens a browser through RSelenium, so be sure that \code{startServer} has been called a few seconds earlier - the server start needs some seconds. This inconvenience will be elliminated later.

If either \code{login_name} or \code{login_password} missing, the function will wait until the user does not log in.
}
\value{
A character vector with profile names/ids of the users who are allowed to see among the user's friends. These values can be used as the \code{user} argument of this function.
